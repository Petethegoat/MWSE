An instance of `niSkinDataBoneDataVertexWeight` exists for every vertex that is influenced by a particular bone. This container stores the weight coefficients used for each vertex when deforming skinned objects with this bone.

## Properties

### `index`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">index</div>

The index of the vertex in the skinned object's array of vertices.

**Returns**:

* `result` (integer)

***

### `weight`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">weight</div>

The weight of the bone's influence on the vertex. The sum of the weights for all the bones that influence a particular vertex must be 1.0.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)
