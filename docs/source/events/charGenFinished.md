This event is triggered when the character generation process at the start of the game has been finished. In an unmodded version of Morrowind, this event would trigger after leaving the 'Census and Excise Office' in 'Seyda Neen'.

```lua
--- @param e charGenFinishedEventData
local function charGenFinishedCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.charGenFinished, charGenFinishedCallback)
```

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.
